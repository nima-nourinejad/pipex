# Pipex


## Project Overview

Pipex is a Unix mechanism implementation project that explores the use of pipes in a C program. The project aims to replicate the functionality of a shell command by manipulating input and output streams using pipes and process execution.

## Key Features

- **Pipe Handling**: Pipex manages input and output streams between two commands (`cmd1` and `cmd2`) using Unix pipes, enabling seamless communication between processes.
- **File I/O**: The program reads from `file1` and writes to `file2`, integrating file I/O operations with pipe redirection to mimic shell command behavior.
- **Error Handling**: Thorough error handling ensures the program gracefully handles errors without unexpected termination, adhering to Unix shell command standards.

## Why Choose This Project?

- **Unix Mechanism Understanding**: By implementing Pipex, developers deepen their understanding of Unix mechanisms, particularly pipe-based communication between processes.
- **C Programming Proficiency**: Successfully completing Pipex demonstrates proficiency in C programming, including file I/O operations, process management, and error handling.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Pipex challenges developers to solve complex problems related to inter-process communication, file redirection, and error management, fostering problem-solving skills crucial for software development.
- **Adherence to Coding Standards**: The project adheres to coding standards and best practices, ensuring clean, maintainable code that meets project requirements.
